# Desipe 🥘
Desipe is an Indian Recipe App 🍜 that I created to demonstrate some of the commonly used libraries in Android development.

## Download 📥
The release APK can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Pinaki93/Desipe/tree/master/apk).

## Architecture 🏗️
I've used Google [recommended app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide) following `Model-View-ViewModel` (MVVM) architecture, exposing `PresentationModel`s out from the `ViewModel`s wrapped in `LiveData`s to guide the UI in a lifecycle aware manner.
